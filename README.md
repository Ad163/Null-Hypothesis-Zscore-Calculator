# Null-Hypothesis-Zscore-Calculator
Null Hypothesis Zscore Calculator can be used to calculate the null hypothesis of a Dataset with Ztest. Dataset that are up to Data point are calculated with Ztest.
A z-score null hypothesis calculator is a statistical tool used to calculate the probability of observing a certain outcome or set of outcomes under the assumption that there is no significant difference between two groups. The null hypothesis in this context states that the mean of one group is equal to the mean of another group, and any observed differences are due to chance.

To use a z-score null hypothesis calculator, one needs to input the sample size, sample mean, sample standard deviation, and the hypothesized value for the population mean. The calculator then generates a z-score, which is a measure of how many standard deviations away from the mean a given data point falls. This z-score is used to determine the probability (p-value) of obtaining the observed results by chance alone.

If the p-value is less than the predetermined significance level, the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating that there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups. If the p-value is greater than the significance level, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, and it is assumed that any observed differences are due to chance.

Overall, a z-score null hypothesis calculator is a valuable tool for researchers and analysts who need to make informed decisions based on statistical data. By providing an objective measure of the likelihood of obtaining certain results, it helps ensure that conclusions drawn from data analysis are reliable and credible.
